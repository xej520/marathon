  * Regression Test for https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/issues/3783
  *
  * Intention:
  * During an abdication, there should be a deployment in progress, containing at
  * least one running task. This running task should not be killed/replaced during
  * the next leader takes over the deployment.
  *
  * Adapted from https://github.com/EvanKrall/reproduce_marathon_issue_3783
